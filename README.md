# Project: Landing Page
For [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

## Overview
A webpage showing my love for frogs! You can view it here: https://hmhoa.github.io/landing-page/

In this project, I got to create my very first "landing page" using HTML and CSS foundations including Flexbox. This website is made using the base design provided by The Odin Project, which is also uploaded under [./design/](https://github.com/hmhoa/landing-page/tree/main/design). Also found in this directory is my preliminary breakdown of the design into a "skeleton box layout"- something easier for me to visualize and implement using MS Paint. This was especially helpful for determining which containers will be flex containers.

I will definitely customize and personalize this page a bit more someday, but for now, have some frogs. :)
